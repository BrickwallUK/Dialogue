Social Logins
------------------------
Facebook uses OAuth 2.0 for authentication and communication. In order for
users to authenticate with the Facebook API, you must specify the ID, secret and redirect
URI of your Facebook app. You can create a new app at the following URL:
https://developers.facebook.com/

Notice: When a user authenticates with the Facebook API, an access token
is saved along with information about the user. With the Facebook API, access tokens will
expire after roughly two months.
        
Notice: When a user is redirected to the Facebook login dialog, the scope
(permissions of the app) is specified. It is currently not possible to specify a scope, but
this will be possible in a future version of this package. The current scope sent to the
login dialog is: <samp>read_stream user_status user_about_me user_photos</samp>.

Google uses <strong>OAuth 2.0</strong> for authentication and communication. In order for
users to authenticate with the Google API, you must specify the ID, secret and redirect URI
of your Google app. You can create a new app at the following URL:
<strong>https://console.developers.google.com/project</strong>

<strong>Notice:</strong> When a user authenticates with the Google API, a refresh token is
saved along with information about the user. The refresh token can be used to obtain an
access token, which again can be used to make calls to the Google API. Refresh tokens will
not expire unless the user deauthorizes the app. Access tokens will only have a lifetime of
about an hour.

<strong>Notice:</strong> When a user is redirected to the Google login dialog, the scope
(permissions of the app) is specified. It is currently not possible to specify a scope, but
this will be possible in a future version of this package. The current scope sent to the
login dialog is: <samp>openid email profile</samp>.
